12:05:31.946 (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
12:05:31.946 - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
12:05:31.946 - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
12:05:31.946 - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
